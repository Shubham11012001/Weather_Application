# Weather_Application
Developed in love with Kotlin

This android application uses openweatherapi for fetching the weather details, as the api is free so it consists max 60 calls
in an hour.
The language used for developing this application is Kotlin, which is official language for android app development by GOOGLE.


The three main concepts or core concepts of Kotlin used are:
1. Working with API and JSON
2. Object oriented Concepts
3. Exception Handling

Kotlin is one of the beautiful staticlly typed language with Nullpointer exception safety.
UI may look not good but it is just my start to work on Android Technology



That's all. It is supported in any android device.
Like Smartphone and tablet
